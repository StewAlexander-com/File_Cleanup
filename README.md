# File Cleanup

A Python utility that automatically organizes files by their extension into dedicated folders. Perfect for cleaning up cluttered directories and maintaining an organized file structure.

## Features

- 🗂️ **Automatic Organization**: Sorts files by extension into dedicated folders
- 🔄 **Duplicate Handling**: Interactive prompts for handling duplicate files
- ✅ **Verification**: Automatically verifies that all files are correctly organized
- 📝 **Logging**: Maintains a detailed log of all organization activities
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- 🚫 **Safe**: Ignores hidden files and preserves existing folder structures
- 📂 **Directory Browser TUI**: Interactive file browser for easy directory selection (similar to 'nnn')

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No additional dependencies required (uses Python standard library only)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stewartalexander/File_Cleanup.git
   cd File_Cleanup
   ```

2. **Make the script executable** (macOS/Linux):
   ```bash
   chmod +x file_cleanup.py
   ```

   **Note**: On Windows, this step is optional as Python scripts can be run directly.

3. **Verify Python installation**:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   # or on Windows:
   python --version
   ```

## How to Run

### macOS and Linux

**Method 1: Direct execution** (if made executable):
```bash
./file_cleanup.py
```

**Method 2: Using Python interpreter**:
```bash
python3 file_cleanup.py
```

### Windows

**Method 1: Using Python launcher**:
```bash
python file_cleanup.py
```

**Method 2: Using Python 3 explicitly**:
```bash
py -3 file_cleanup.py
```

**Method 3: Double-click** (if Python is associated with `.py` files):
- Simply double-click `file_cleanup.py` in File Explorer

### Usage

1. Run the script using one of the methods above
2. When prompted, choose how to select the directory:
   - **[1] Type path manually**: Enter the full or relative path
   - **[2] Browse directories**: Use the interactive directory browser (TUI)
   - **[3] Use current directory**: Select the current working directory
   - **[q] Cancel**: Exit the program

3. **Directory Browser (Option 2)**:
   - **macOS/Linux**: Uses `curses` for a full-screen file browser with arrow key navigation
   - **Windows**: Uses a simple numbered menu interface
   - Navigate with arrow keys (or numbers on Windows)
   - Press Enter to select a directory
   - Type `t` to manually enter a path while browsing
   - Type `h` to jump to home directory
   - Type `q` or ESC to cancel

4. The program will:
   - Scan for files in the directory
   - Create folders based on file extensions (e.g., `pdf/`, `jpg/`, `txt/`)
   - Move files into their respective folders
   - Prompt you if duplicate files are found
   - Verify the organization
   - Create/update a log file

### Example Session

```
File Organizer v1.0
============================================================

How would you like to select the directory?
  [1] Type path manually
  [2] Browse directories
  [3] Use current directory (.)
  [q] Cancel

Enter choice: 2

[Directory Browser opens - navigate with arrow keys, press Enter to select]

Organizing: Downloads/
------------------------------------------------------------
✓ Created: pdf/
  → document1.pdf
  → report.pdf
→ Using: jpg/
  → photo.jpg
  → image.jpg

⚠ 'duplicate.txt' exists in txt/. Overwrite? (y/n): n
  → duplicate_copy1.txt

--- Verification ---
✓ All files organized correctly

✓ Log updated: organization_log.txt

============================================================
✓ Organization complete
```

## What the Program Does

### Core Functionality

1. **File Scanning**: Scans the specified directory for all files (excluding hidden files starting with `.`)

2. **Folder Creation**: Creates folders named after file extensions (e.g., `pdf/`, `jpg/`, `txt/`). Files without extensions go into a `no_extension/` folder.

3. **File Organization**: Moves each file into its corresponding extension folder

4. **Duplicate Handling**: 
   - If a file with the same name already exists in the target folder, you'll be prompted to overwrite or create a copy
   - Copies are automatically named with `_copy1`, `_copy2`, etc.

5. **Verification**: Recursively checks that all files are in the correct folders based on their extensions

6. **Logging**: Creates or appends to `organization_log.txt` with:
   - Timestamp of each run
   - List of folders created or used
   - Files moved into each folder
   - Status (NEW folder vs EXISTING folder)

### Output

The program produces:

- **Organized directory structure**: Files sorted into extension-based folders
- **Console output**: Real-time feedback showing:
  - Folders created or reused
  - Files being moved
  - Verification results
- **Log file** (`organization_log.txt`): Detailed history of all organization runs

### Example Output Structure

```
Downloads/
├── pdf/
│   ├── document1.pdf
│   └── report.pdf
├── jpg/
│   ├── photo.jpg
│   └── image.jpg
├── txt/
│   ├── notes.txt
│   └── duplicate_copy1.txt
└── organization_log.txt
```

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability and correctness of all functionality.

### Running Tests

To run the complete test suite:

```bash
python3 test_file_cleanup.py
```

**Note**: On Windows, use `python` instead of `python3`.

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes **18 comprehensive tests** covering all aspects of the program:

#### Core Functionality Tests
- ✅ **File Extension Extraction**: Tests case-insensitive extension handling and files without extensions
- ✅ **Basic File Organization**: Verifies files are correctly sorted into extension-based folders
- ✅ **No Extension Handling**: Ensures files without extensions go into `no_extension/` folder
- ✅ **Hidden Files**: Confirms hidden files (starting with `.`) are properly ignored
- ✅ **Case-Insensitive Extensions**: Tests that `.PDF`, `.pdf`, and `.Pdf` all go to the same folder

#### Duplicate Handling Tests
- ✅ **Overwrite Option**: Tests interactive overwrite when duplicates are found
- ✅ **Copy Creation**: Verifies automatic copy naming (`_copy1`, `_copy2`, etc.)
- ✅ **Multiple Copies**: Tests sequential copy generation when multiple copies exist

#### Advanced Features Tests
- ✅ **Existing Folders**: Verifies reuse of pre-existing extension folders
- ✅ **Organization Verification**: Tests detection of correctly and incorrectly organized files
- ✅ **Top-Level File Detection**: Ensures verification catches misplaced files
- ✅ **Log File Handling**: Confirms log files are allowed in top-level directory

#### Logging Tests
- ✅ **Log Creation**: Verifies log file is created with correct format
- ✅ **Log Appending**: Tests that multiple runs append to log rather than overwrite
- ✅ **Log Content**: Validates log includes all required information (timestamps, file lists, folder status)

#### Integration Tests
- ✅ **Complete Workflow**: Tests end-to-end execution from main function
- ✅ **Invalid Directory Handling**: Verifies error handling for non-existent directories
- ✅ **Empty Directory Handling**: Tests behavior when no files are present

### Test Results

All tests are currently **passing** ✅:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 18 tests in 0.018s

OK
```

### Test Architecture

- **Isolated Testing**: Each test runs in a temporary directory that is automatically cleaned up
- **Mocking**: Uses `unittest.mock` to handle interactive prompts during testing
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover normal operations, edge cases, and error conditions
- **No Side Effects**: Tests don't modify your actual files or directories

### Running Tests on Different Operating Systems

The test suite is **cross-platform** and works identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux:

**macOS/Linux**:
```bash
python3 test_file_cleanup.py
```

**Windows**:
```bash
python test_file_cleanup.py
```

All tests use Python's standard library and `pathlib`, ensuring consistent behavior across platforms.
